<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> In this project, we investigated  social media users' perceptions of digital political ads. We measured users' opinions on how platforms should design political ad UX and policies with the goal of establishing a baseline understanding of user opinions including the permissibly of political ads, microtargeting, transparency, and exemptions for news organizations.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> The primary objective of this research was to understand what factors of ads (and users themselves) may contribute to their perceptions of how `political' given digital ads are. To do this, we conducted a conjoint experiment asking respondents to compare artificial Facebook ads where we alter their source, content, and political orientation. This conjoint design allows us to isolate the independent effects of each component on perceptions of the political.  </p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> We designed a conjoint experiment to understand how individual components of composite stimuli affect human judgements and perceptions. We also conducted a within-between experiment asking respondents to evaluate real ads drawn from the Facebook Ad Library. </p>

In this project we explored the utility of corrections to misinformation on social media. We posit that comments from a member of one's in-group may be more effective in promoting accurate beliefs relative to members of out-groups, especially when the misinformation relates to their ethnic group. Corrections have been shown to be more persuasive when coming from trusted sources. There are few source cues available to individuals in posts and comments on social media. We believe individuals will rely on cues such as name and profile picture to evaluate their closeness to one's ethnic group. We suspect that in-group closeness will increase the credibility of a comment relative to a comment from a member of another group because of the sense of cohesion between members of the same ethnic group.

Hypothesis 1: Corrective comments will reduce misperceptions (i.e. misperceptions will be lower in the correction conditions than in the no correction condition and control condition).

Hypothesis 2: Corrective comments from culturally relevant organizations will more effectively reduce misperceptions.

To test if corrective comments from in-groups are more effective than comments from members of other groups in promoting accurate beliefs we conducted three experiments.

The experiments relied on two survey waves that contained an oversampling of black (both surveys) and Latino (first survey only) respondents. Both experiments were sponsored by the Weidenbaum center and distributed by NORC.

Study 1 had a total of 2030 respondents. There were ~500 black respondents and ~500 Latino respondents.

Study 2 had a total of 1502 which included ~500 black respondents.

Across the two experiments we found no evidence supporting our theories. Study 1 found that providing corrections in the comments is an effective means to reducing misperceptions, however, the culturally relevant correction was not particularly effective among Latinos. Study 2 did not find results to uphold the theory that culturally relevant comments are more effective at reducing misperceptions. Among all participants in both experiments, the in-groups were the most effective, which may suggest that members of out-groups defer to other ethnic groups when the misinformation does not relate to them.

  <li><strong>Mathematical modeling</strong> (2017)<br>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Taught by Randy Calvert. Primary materials: <i>Mathematics for Economists</i> (Pemberton and Rau). Required.<br>
  This course covered single-variable calculus and portions of multi-variate calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory exposing us to topics including sets and relations; probability; differential calculus and optimization; difference equations; and linear algebra.</li></p>
