</ul>

 <h3 style="color:Black;font-size:18px;"> Summary</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">The purpose of this project was to explore the ways discourse varies dependent upon the news outlet reporting. To do so, we collected Tweets shared by news organizations and their replies dating back to 2017. The data collected yielded (soon to be published) insights into variations such as sentiment and similarity. It also invited the use of  techniques such as topic modeling and interrupted times series analyses surrounding the events of January 6, 2022. We sought to understand patterns related to the emotional charge and sentiment of text and how this varied across different news outlets and topics.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> My major contribution to this project was the development of a reliable ETL pipeline that enabled non-methods researchers to easily load and explore the data. To do so, I first created a a Python script to parse and normalize the data. This involved pagination to fetch large volumes of data and error handling to handle API rate limits and other potential issues. The data retrieved included tweet-level information, media-level information, and context annotations. Logging was implemented to track the progress of the script and help diagnose issues that may arise during the data collection process. The main function was to allow multiple users to divide the work and run the script in parallel without repetition. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> I then developed a program that allowed users to automatically extract useful metrics from the data, store the cleansed data in a SQL database and prevent duplicate data processing. This program included preprocessing the text data with methods such as removing unnecessary characters, renaming columns, extracting links, tokenization, lemmatization and calculating various text-based metrics like average word length and total word count. Other features include an  unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations of words and computing the subjectivity, polarity, and sentiment analysis scores for each tweet</p>

 <h3 style="color:Black;font-size:18px;"> Summary</h3>


<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> In this project, we investigated  social media users' perceptions of digital political ads. We measured users' opinions on how platforms should design political ad UX and policies with the goal of establishing a baseline understanding of user opinions' including the permissibly of political ads and microtargeting, transparency in funding.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> The primary objective of this research was to understand what factors of ads (and users themselves) may contribute to their perceptions of how `political' given digital ads are. To do this, we conducted a conjoint experiment asking respondents to compare artificial Facebook ads where we alter their source, content, and political orientation. This conjoint design allows us to isolate the independent effects of each component on perceptions of the political.  </p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;"> We also conducted a within-between experiment asking respondents to evaluate real ads drawn from the Facebook Ad Library. In this portion of the project, we randomly assigned respondents' to view either a political or non-political advertisement and asked to rate how political they perceived it to be. Respondents rated multiple ads (within-subject variation) but the exact composition of the ads was randomized for each respondent (between-subject variation </p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">Overall, our conjoint analysis strongly supports our original research hypotheses showing that the source, strength, and orientation of the message all matter. We found that candidate ads seem to be viewed as inherently political, in contrast to sources such as politically active companies and advocacy organizations, where message strength appears to matter far more in order for an ad to be considered political. This differs from our finding in the conjoint analysis, where ads from companies and advocacy organizations were viewed as equally political.</p>

 <h3 style="color:Black;font-size:18px;"> Summary</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">In this project we explored the utility of corrections to misinformation on social media. We posit that comments from a member of one's in-group may be more effective in promoting accurate beliefs relative to members of out-groups, especially when the misinformation relates to their ethnic group. We believe individuals will rely on cues such as name and profile picture to evaluate their closeness to one's ethnic group. We suspect that in-group closeness will increase the credibility of a comment relative to a comment from a member of another group because of the sense of cohesion between members of the same ethnic group.</p>


<li><p style="padding-left: 10px;">Hypothesis 1: Corrective comments will reduce misperceptions (i.e. misperceptions will be lower in the correction conditions than in the no correction condition and control condition)</p></li>

<li><p style="padding-left: 10px;">Hypothesis 2: Corrective comments from culturally relevant organizations will more effectively reduce misperceptions</p></li>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">To test if corrective comments from in-groups are more effective than comments from members of other groups in promoting accurate beliefs we conducted three experiments. In these experiments, we presented respondents' with a fake Facebook posts containing misinformation targeting specific ethnic groups. We randomly sorted participants into conditions in which they either saw (1) no misinformation post and no comments; (2) misinformation post and no replies (3) misinformation post with in-group correction (4) misinforation post with out-group correction. Before and after the treatment (misinformation post) participants were asked their belief in specific misinformation. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">The experiments relied on two survey waves that contained an oversampling of black (both surveys) and Latino (first survey only) respondents. Both experiments were sponsored by the Weidenbaum center and distributed by NORC. Study 1 had a total of 2030 respondents. There were ~500 black respondents and ~500 Latino respondents. Study 2 had a total of 1502 which included ~500 black respondents</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">Across the two experiments we found no evidence supporting our theories. Study 1 found that providing corrections in the comments is an effective means to reducing misperceptions, however, the culturally relevant correction was not particularly effective among Latinos. Study 2 did not find results to uphold the theory that culturally relevant comments are more effective at reducing misperceptions. Among all participants in both experiments, the in-group corrections from those who were the target of misinformation was most effective, which may suggest that members of out-groups defer to other ethnic groups when the misinformation does not relate to them</p>

<ul style="text-indent: 20px;margin-left:0px;">
    <li>Formulated a compelling hypothesis on motivated reasoning and logical argument evaluation in political science</li>
  <li>Designed 2 large-n survey experiments generating a robust and insightful data set</li>
  <li>Secured ethics approval, upholding the highest research standards</li>
  <li>Conducted advanced data analysis with R packages, revealing key insights on argument evaluation and objectivity interventions</li>
  </ul></p>
  
 <h3 style="color:Black;font-size:18px;"> Summary</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">This data science project investigated the influence of motivated reasoning on individuals' evaluation of logical arguments, addressing three key questions:
<p style="padding-left: 10px;">1. Can individuals distinguish between strong (logically consistent) and weak (logically flawed) arguments?
2. Are evaluations of argument quality biased by individuals' pre-existing beliefs?
3. Can biases in argument evaluation be mitigated by priming the competing goal of objectivity?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5px;">Utilizing R and our team designed and conducted two large-n survey experiments, the study found that individuals can distinguish between strong and weak arguments, but exhibit an argument congruency bias favoring statements aligned with their preferences. This bias persisted across strong and weak arguments, political and non-political topics, and multiple issue areas.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5px;">The project also evaluated the effectiveness of priming objectivity goals in reducing biases in argument evaluation. The first study suggested potential improvements in weak argument evaluation accuracy, while the second study showed no measurable effect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 5px;">This research revealed the pervasiveness of argument congruency bias and demonstrated that individuals' biases influence, but do not entirely overwhelm, their ability to accurately rate argument quality. By exploring the potential of priming objectivity as an intervention, this project contributed valuable insights into argument evaluation and strategies for reducing motivated.</p>
