## Objectives

The goal of this conference is to enable and nurture conversations which might not otherwise occur about how to make data actionable. The topic of the meeting is local government responsiveness.  

### The Mayoral Classification Challenge

The aim of our conference will be to establish which elected mayor does the best job engaging with citizens: this outcome can be measured in a couple of different ways. We will collect  the social media data (both comments and reactions on Twitter and FB) from all mayors in the United States who are included in the Council of Mayors (mayors who are in cities over 30,000 residents).  Separately we will also collect data on mayoral traits: vote share in their elections, the length of their service in office, the type of primary election, their gender, their previous elected experience, their partisanship, their race, their ethnicity, whether they were elected in a partisan election, etc.).   We will encourage you and your team to exploit the data we have provided, to think deeply about methods and measurement, and to consider seriously what criteria we should use in evaluating mayoral responsiveness.
