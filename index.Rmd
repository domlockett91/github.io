Hi! I am a political science PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis. I study political methodology and American political behavior, with an emphasis on the effects of class and social identities. My research relies on experimental methods to understand how identity develops over time and the ways in which identity interacts with forms of communication and decision making.</p>
