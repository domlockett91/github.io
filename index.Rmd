I am a computational scientist who will earn my Ph.D in Political Science from the Washington University in St. Louis in the Spring of 2023. I have hands-on experience using machine learning tools and causal inference techniques to study online behavior. The majority of my research revolves around social media with projects exploring opinions on political ads, the impact of misinformation interventions, the downstream effects of uncivil speech and how various news organizations evoke different types of replies.
</p>
<p>
My methodological contributions include designing and implementing automated ETL pipelines for the processing of billions of Tweets; analyzing and visualizing complex models; contributions in the creation of R package `catSurv`; project management from the experimental design phase through publication, etc.

<p>
My primary teaching experience comes from my course Python for Beginners course where I designed the curriculum and taught students the basics of object-oriented programming while preparing them to manage collaborative projects using GitHub and JupyterLab.
